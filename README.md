# Cloud Service class library.
The Cloud Service class library objective is to create a library for a company to create and maintain their cloud infrastructure efficiently without needing to have deep knowledge about different cloud providers. This library will introduce APIs and abstractions that developers can use to design and implement cloud agnostic infrastructure. The client wants to start the first phase by supporting only virtual machines and database servers. But they would want more resources (i.e. load balancers, elastic file storage etc) at later stages. They want to be able to create both Windows and Linux instances. For database servers they want support for both MySQL and SQL Server. The client wants to be able to create multiple infrastructures as well, for example they want to create a UAT infrastructure for one project and a Test infrastructure for one project and a Test infrastructure for their internal team.
